Two-Sum-Problem
===============

Solution for the two sum problem, given a array of integers (unsorted) how many distinct values t in some range [-a,a] exist such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t.

2sum-input.txt:

The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative, with the ith row of the file specifying the ith entry of the array.


Test files:

test_twosum.txt should give 5 t values in range [-10000,10000]
test2_twosum.txt should give 3 t values in range [-10000,10000]
